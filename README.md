1. ## Call Stack (1)
-  When a function is called, a new entry representing that function call is added to the top of the call stack. Similarly, when a function returns, its entry is removed from the stack. This process of adding and removing function calls from the stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
-  It ensures that functions are executed in the correct order and that the program behaves as expected. If the call stack becomes too large (due to too many nested function calls), it can lead to a stack overflow error.
- When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. 
In summary
The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.

eg:
```
function firstFunction() {
    secondFunction();
}
function secondFunction() {
    thirdFunction();
}
function thirdFunction() {
    // Do something
}
firstFunction(); // Initial function call
```


2. ## Primitive types (2)
they are data types in javascript that are imutable(cannot be changed). they are also know us inbuilt data types.
eg: numbers, strings, boolean, null, undefined, symbol.
### Numbers
are data types that can hold  numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
Strings are data types that represent a sequence of characters that are sorrounded by singel or double coats.
### Booleans
are data types that can accept only two values. ie true and false.
### Null
is a data type that can hold one possible value ie null or it is a declared binding or variable with the absence of a value.
### Undefined
is a variable declared without an assigned value.
### Symbols
are used to create unique identifiers for object properties. it is used to create objects that will always be unique. (ES2015).
### BigInts 
are used to store integers that too large to store us numbers. (ES2020).

1. = means assignment operator.
2. Pure functions these are function that donot affect anything outside their scope.


3. ## Value types and Reference types (3)
### Value Types (Primitive Types):
Stored Directly: Value types are stored directly in the variable's memory location.
Immutable: The value of a variable of a primitive type cannot be changed after it has been created.
Examples: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol.

Examples in JavaScript:
let num = 10;
let name = 'John';
let isActive = true;

### Reference Types:
Stored by Reference: Reference types are stored as a reference (or pointer) to a location in memory where the actual data is stored.
Mutable: The content of a reference type variable can be changed after it has been created.

Examples: object, array, function.
Examples in JavaScript:
let person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
function greet() { console.log('Hello!'); }
Differences:

Storage:
Value types are stored directly in memory where the variable is allocated.
Reference types are stored in memory heap, and variables store references to the memory location.

Mutability:
Value types are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after creation.
Reference types are mutable, meaning their content can be changed after creation.

Assignment Behavior:
When assigning a value type to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
When assigning a reference type to another variable, both variables point to the same object in memory.

Comparison:
Value types are compared by their actual value.
Reference types are compared by their reference (memory address), not by the content they store.

-There are a handful of values in Javascript that return falsy values, they are:

false
0
null
undefined
""
NaN
-0
**NaN** is the only Javascript value that is not equal to itself
